  <h1>What this is about</h1>
  <p>Just trying out Github Pages with a simple static publication flow.</p>
  <p>And also playing around with HTML5 and CSS</p>
  <p>Does editing in vi in the Codepsaces terminal work? How does it sync with the VS Code editor?</p>
  <p>Works. It syncs immediately when the file is saved. Quite nice.</p>
  <p>How to preview stuff in Codespaces?</p>
